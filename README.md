**# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION PROJECT #**



This project is about predicting whether CUSTOMER will stay back with the bank or switchover.



columns of the data include 1.customer_id 2.credit_score 3.country 4.age 5.gender 6.tenure 7.balance 8.products_number 9.credit_cards 10.active_member 11.estimated salary 12.churn

I have dropped columns like customer_id,country,age, gender for better results.
I have added churn as my target columnn


Based on the above data our model will predict whether churn will be 0 0r 1 .(0-customer will stay back, 1- customer will leave)

Process of operations



1. Loading the data into a dataFrame
2. cleaning the data
3. preprocessing the data
4. creating a model and training the model with training set
5. predicting the model
6. evaluating the model
8. making the model predict with new set of unseen data
9. visualisation with graph using two parameters.





The model has been tested with new set of datas and the prediction accuracy stands to 84 percentage approximately.
